"""Merit -> Control Point (CP) conversion formulas for PowerPlay activities.

The journal's "PowerplayMerits" event reports the commander's actual merit
take, after every multiplier the game applies (system strength/frontline
penalties, ethos buffs, Squadron PP bonus, etc.). It does *not* say how many
Control Points that represents for the target system — that depends on which
activity (Acquisition / Reinforcement / Undermining) earned it, and Frontier
has never documented the conversion in the journal.

The ratios below are the best community-sourced figures available for
Powerplay 2.0. They are deliberately kept as plain, user-editable settings
(see powerplay.py) rather than baked into the code, since they are estimates
and Frontier is known to tune Powerplay balance between updates.
